# TRUST: Towards Racially Unbiased Skin Tone Estimation via Scene Disambiguation (ECCV2022)

This is the official Pytorch implementation of TRUST. 

* We identify, analyze and quantify the problem of biased facial albedo estimation.
* We propose [FAIR Challenge](https://trust.is.tue.mpg.de), a new synthetic benchmark including novel evaluation protocol that measures albedo estimation in terms of skin tone and diversity.
* We propose TRUST, a new network that estimates facial albedo with **more accuracy and less bias** in skin tone, hence the reconstructed 3D head avatar can be faithful and inclusive from a single image. 

Please refer to the [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03962) for more details.
## Getting Started
Clone the repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/HavenFeng/TRUST/
  cd TRUST
  ```

### Requirements
* Python 3.8 (numpy, skimage, scipy, opencv)  
* PyTorch >= 1.7 (pytorch3d compatible)  
  You can run 
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  If you encountered errors when installing PyTorch3D, please follow the [official installation guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md) to re-install the library.

### Usage
1. **Prepare data & models**

    Please check our [project website](https://trust.is.tue.mpg.de) to download the FAIR benchmark dataset and our released pretrained models.    
    After downloading the pretrained models, put them in ./data

2. **Run test**  
    a. FAIR benchmark
    ```bash
    python test.py --test_folder '/path/to/trust_models' --test_split val
    ```   
    change the test_split flag to run on test set or validation set.


## Evaluation
TRUST (ours) achieves 57% lower error of the total score (35% lower on Average ITA error, 77% lower on Bias error),  on the [FAIR Challenge](https://trust.is.tue.mpg.de/challenge.html) compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.  

For more details of the evaluation, please check our [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03962).
